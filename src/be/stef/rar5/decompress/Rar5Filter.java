/**
 * Represents a RAR5 post-processing filter.
 * 
 * <p>RAR5 supports several filter types for improving compression of specific
 * data types:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>DELTA (0) - For audio data with multiple channels</li>
 *   <li>E8 (1) - For x86 executables (CALL instructions)</li>
 *   <li>E8E9 (2) - For x86 executables (CALL and JMP instructions)</li>
 *   <li>ARM (3) - For ARM executables</li>
 * </ul>

 * <p><b>Note:</b> Field names use uppercase to match the original 7-zip
 * implementation for clarity and debugging purposes.</p>
